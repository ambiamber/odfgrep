odfgrep - grep utility for searching ODF documents

Currently only text documents are supported. The documents
must follow the ISO/OASIS Open Document Format standard.

The usual grep command line options are supported, as much
as make sense for searching documents instead of text files.

The actual pattern matching is handled by Boost.Regex.
